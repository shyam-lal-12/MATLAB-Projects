# Humidity Alert

Using Simulink environment to develop and implement a Humidity Alert System for residents that automatically alerts the residents if the room is not in optimal humidity levels of 20% to 50% using a Buzzer. An additional feature of snoozing the alert using an IR Remote controller has also been implemented.
